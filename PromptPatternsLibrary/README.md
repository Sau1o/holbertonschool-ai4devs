# Prompt Patterns Library

## 📘 Introduction
This repository consolidates all prompt templates developed and tested during the project into a single, categorized library.  
Each prompt pattern follows a consistent structure designed to improve clarity, reusability, and control over AI behavior across different domains — from software engineering to creative writing and communication.  

The purpose of this library is to serve as a **reference hub** for designing structured, role-based, and tone-aware prompts that can be directly applied in production systems, educational environments, or automation pipelines.

## 🗂️ Categories Overview

### 1. **Code Quality**
Prompts focused on improving, refactoring, and documenting code.  
- [Refactoring](./prompts/refactoring.md) – Enhance readability and maintainability of existing code.  
- [Code Review](./prompts/code_review.md) – Evaluate code clarity, efficiency, and best practices.  
- [Documentation](./prompts/documentation.md) – Generate or improve docstrings and technical documentation.  

---

### 2. **Debugging**
Prompts for error analysis, troubleshooting, and bug pattern identification.  
- [Error Analysis](./prompts/error_analysis.md) – Diagnose and explain runtime or logical errors.  
- [Bug Explanation](./prompts/bug_explanation.md) – Simplify and clarify error messages for developers.  
- [Fix Suggestions](./prompts/fix_suggestions.md) – Propose potential code fixes with reasoning.

### 3. **Writing & Communication**
Prompts to improve fluency, tone, and structure in written communication.  
- [Rewriting](./prompts/rewriting.md) – Rephrase text while preserving meaning and tone.  
- [Professional Tone](./prompts/professional_tone.md) – Adjust writing style for business or academic contexts.  
- [Summarization](./prompts/summarization.md) – Condense long content into key points or short paragraphs.

### 4. **Creative & Marketing**
Prompts supporting creative ideation, storytelling, and brand-aligned content generation.  
- [Ad Copy](./prompts/ad_copy.md) – Generate persuasive marketing content with tone control.  
- [Storytelling](./prompts/storytelling.md) – Build narratives with emotional impact.  
- [Social Media Posts](./prompts/social_media.md) – Craft short-form content optimized for engagement.  

---

### 5. **Analysis & Planning**
Prompts for analytical reasoning, project design, and structured decision-making.  
- [SWOT Analysis](./prompts/swot_analysis.md) – Evaluate strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.  
- [Project Planning](./prompts/project_planning.md) – Define scope, objectives, and deliverables.  
- [Risk Assessment](./prompts/risk_assessment.md) – Identify and mitigate potential project risks.

## 🧩 Example Usage
For demonstration and tested examples of how to use these templates in real workflows, see:  
👉 [prompt_examples.md](./prompt_examples.md)

Each example shows:
- The **input structure** (role, tone, placeholders)
- The **expected AI behavior**
- The **output style** that follows from the given structure

## 🧠 Purpose & Maintenance
This library is designed for ongoing improvement.  
New prompt patterns can be added under `/prompts/` following the naming convention `category_name.md` and should include:
- A short description of purpose
- Example prompt structure
- Variations and tone adjustments

All contributions should aim to maintain **clarity, modularity, and practical reusability** across contexts.
