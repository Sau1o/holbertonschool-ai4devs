## Purpose
Enable users to control and monitor IoT devices (lights, thermostat, security cameras) from a centralized, intuitive interface, optimizing energy consumption and home security.

- **Room Detail**: Grid view of all devices assigned to a specific room (e.g., Living Room, Bedroom).
- **Automation/Scenes**: List of scheduled tasks and "If/Then" logic setup.
- **Energy Analytics**: Graphs showing power consumption over time.

## Actions
- Toggle devices On/Off.
- Adjust sliders for attributes (Brightness, Temperature, Volume).
- Create and edit "Scenes" (groups of device settings).
- View live video feed from security cameras.
