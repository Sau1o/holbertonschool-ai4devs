# User Stories

| ID | As a... | I want to... | So that... |
|----|---------|--------------|------------|
| 1  | Mobile User | record a voice command directly in the app | I can trigger automations while driving or walking without typing. |
| 2  | Mobile User | type a text command manually | I can execute workflows silently when I cannot speak. |
| 3  | Power User | register a new Webhook URL with a name and schema description | the AI knows where to send my requests (e.g., "Add Lead" -> n8n webhook). |
| 4  | User | receive a confirmation notification after the workflow triggers | I know the system successfully understood and executed my command. |
| 5  | User | view a history log of my recent commands | I can verify if a specific task was sent earlier today. |
| 6  | Admin/Dev | see the JSON payload generated by the AI before it is sent (debug mode) | I can ensure the entity extraction is accurate. |
| 7  | System | automatically transcribe audio using a Speech-to-Text API | raw audio is converted into text the LLM can process. |
| 8  | System | classify the user's intent against the list of registered webhooks | the correct automation is triggered even if I use slightly different phrasing. |
