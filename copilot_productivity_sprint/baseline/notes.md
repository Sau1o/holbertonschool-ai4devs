## Task Performance Summary

| Task ID | Task Name | Time Spent | Status | Friction Points / Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1** | Log Parser (Python) | 22 mins | Complete | Had to look up `re` (regex) syntax documentation for Python groups. Forgot `newline=''` in CSV writer initially. |
| **2** | User Card (React) | 18 mins | Complete | Spent time debating between CSS modules vs Tailwind. Typed out the Interface manually which took a moment. |
| **3** | Sales Analysis (SQL) | 14 mins | Complete | Syntax check for `EXTRACT(YEAR...)` vs `YEAR()` depending on dialect. Double-checked the `JOIN` logic. |

**Total Time (Manual):** 54 minutes

## General Observations
- Significant context switching required to check documentation for specific syntax (Regex and SQL Date functions).
- Boilerplate code (React component structure, CSV setup) consumed a chunk of the time.
