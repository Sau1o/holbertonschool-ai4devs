# Workflow Baseline

## Current IDE Setup
- **IDE:** Visual Studio Code
- **Key Extensions:** GitHub Copilot, Prettier, ESLint, Java Extension Pack (Spring Boot), Python (Pylance)
- **Workflow Tools:** Docker, WSL2 (Ubuntu), n8n (local instance)

## Pain Points
1. **Manual Boilerplate Generation:** Excessive time spent writing repetitive code for DTOs, Entity mappings, and basic CRUD operations in Java/Spring.
2. **Documentation Drift:** API documentation (Swagger) frequently becomes outdated compared to the actual codebase, causing integration errors.
3. **Slow Debugging Cycle:** The process of switching contexts to run manual tests and scripts is slow and breaks concentration.

## Productivity Metrics
- **Avg task completion:** 90 min (for standard features)
- **Bug fix turnaround:** 2 hours (from report to PR)
- **Weekly commits:** ~25 commits (average)
