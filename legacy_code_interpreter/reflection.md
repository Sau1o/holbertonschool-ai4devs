# Reflection: AI’s Role in Understanding Legacy Systems

## Introduction
Modernizing legacy COBOL systems is often akin to archaeology. In this project, Generative AI served not just as a tool, but as a high-speed translator and pattern recognizer for the "Legacy Payroll System".

## Where AI Explanations Helped Most
The AI excelled at **syntactic decryption**.
- **Spaghetti Code:** It quickly traced non-linear `GO TO` logic in `CALC-PAY.cbl`, saving hours of manual mapping.
- **Jargon:** It translated mainframe terms (VSAM, JCL, PIC) into concepts accessible to modern developers.
- **Boilerplate:** It instantly generated structure for documentation and unit tests, removing the "blank page" friction.

## Where AI Struggled
The main limitation was **context awareness**.
- **The "Why":** AI explained *how* the date windowing worked but missed the historical business context of the chosen pivot year.
- **Data Coupling:** It underestimated the complexity of shared memory (Copybooks), suggesting refactoring strategies that were logically sound but technically risky in a mainframe environment.

## Impact on Strategy
The AI's risk assessment drove us toward a **Strangler Fig pattern**. By highlighting the fragility of the core calculation logic, we decided to extract specific rules incrementally rather than attempting a risky "Big Bang" rewrite.

## Lessons Learned
1.  **Verification is Key:** AI summarizes well but can hallucinate dependencies. Always cross-reference with source code.
2.  **Test Generation:** AI is best used to generate "Golden Data" inputs for regression testing before touching legacy code.
3.  **Living Docs:** Treat documentation as code that is regenerated by AI during the refactoring process.

## Conclusion
AI lowers the barrier to entry for legacy modernization, turning opaque systems into transparent ones, provided it is guided by experienced engineering oversight.
