## Core Workflow
1. **As a Mentor**, I want to paste a URL of a technical documentation page so that the system can automatically extract the relevant text without ads or navigation menus.
2. **As a Content Creator**, I want to select a specific "Tone" (e.g., Professional, Casual, Enthusiastic) before generation so that the output matches my personal brand voice.
3. **As a User**, I want to click a single "Generate" button so that I receive content drafts for LinkedIn, Discord, and Twitter simultaneously.

## Content Management
4. **As a Developer**, I want to view the raw extracted text from the URL before generation so that I can verify if the scraping was successful.
5. **As a Community Manager**, I want the Discord output to automatically include markdown code blocks for snippets so that it is ready to paste into the channel.
6. **As a User**, I want to copy the generated text to my clipboard with one click so that I can easily move it to my social media platform.

## History & Persistence
7. **As a User**, I want to see a list of my last 5 generated sessions in a sidebar so that I can revisit previous ideas without regenerating them.
8. **As a User**, I want the application to save my OpenAI API Key locally so that I don't have to re-enter it every time I restart the app.

## Error Handling
9. **As a User**, I want to receive a clear error message if the provided URL is invalid or blocked so that I know why the extraction failed.
10. **As a User**, I want to be warned if the extracted text exceeds the token limit so that I can manually shorten it or choose a different source.
